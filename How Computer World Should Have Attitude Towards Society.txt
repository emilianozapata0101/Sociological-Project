   Computer world, cyber world or cyber space.These are words to define computer
or internet world.Computer as a hobby attracted many millions or billions in world
to give people a chance to connect with world via text, image or video datas.
In most of time, internet hobbyists did not accepted societal issues in their
internet environment as something acceptable but as soul of internet is free,
everybody from different social background could create website in internet so
internet first isolated society from their playground, second they opened the
gates of internet to everyone to use internet.

   Many companies used internet to have a website to make commercial, it was the
trend at the beginning of internet's rise in popularity sense.These times were
times internet was text based and there was chat rooms, interesting websites,
many developments of programming.These times were most interesting times about 
internet because it was a time like everybody were in a meeting in a library
and it is called internet library because everybody was reading.Time has passed
and internet technologies developed deeply good.Then Chinese internet applications
entered to Western bazaar.Internet has shaped itself into something like video based
and live with youtube, tiktok and kick.com kind websites.Money centered internet
indicated a serious issue about this world, social inequality.Social inequality
was quite visible after some group of people were making money from several websites
and rest of them were unlucky to have money from internet because websites
were not working this way.You were supposed to serve to a social group of internet
money makers and you needed to act like them.They created a social taboo from
internet to bring dirty ideas from real life to internet to have a money kingdom
in internet as internet rich.This was where old capitalism ended.

Solution of internet money corruption is discriminate everyone who are using 
internet for bad intensions.Thus discrimination finds its place because 
dicriminating someone without a reason is badness, discrimination for a legal 
reason is justice.
