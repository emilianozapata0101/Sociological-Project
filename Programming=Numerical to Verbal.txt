   Education system have big inequalities in case of graduating a student.Many
student hated school due to mandatory mathematic lessons.If one student does not
have talent on numerical sciences, student should not be forced to learn these
sciences.It is better to teach a talent to a person then leaving it blank on
board.

   Programming is a talent numerically talented students, computer passionates,
hackers, engineers gain in time by learning from school or from internet lessons.
Unfortunately, many students in school do not have talent to numerical sciences,
that is why they can not learn programming even if they try.It is not a shame
if someone does not have a talent on something.People are diverse in numbers
of stars or planets.If only small percentage of persons initiated to learn
can achieve to be a programmers, it is unfair for majority was not able to
learn.It is same in education, now it is unfair to majority of graduates if
education does not have reform with industries.Till information age, only
numerical people were able to sell their information in a good price due to
its difficulty of learning.It was a fake fair race to prove if person is works
hard he can accomplish anything but it was not true.If person has talent, person
can achieve anything.If there is not talent or effort, achievement was not possible.

   Symbols are not there for just accepting them as they look.Most probably
non-symbolical world is having even problem symbols and its meaning.S is not
a snake for latin alphabet users.But it looks like a snake.Eastern philosophies
assume world is created by symbols and sounds.Programming has variable defined.
Variable is a data, value assigned.For Example $x = 5.X has 5 as value.$x = "John".
X has John as value.If every letter has a sound, and every word has a meaning,
if language is also programmed by previous humans, we live in a world of programming
already.In social world humans already have something similar to programming and
they call it logic.If meaning can be converted into programming blocks or functions,
or functions can be verbalized, maybe programming can be change into something everyone
can build.

   Verbal programming is supposed to consist from words or symbols.If complexity
level or difficulty level of programming languages can be lower to normal languages,
everyone is able to learn programming, thus a website can teach programming to
everyone.If everyone learn how to program, people will not have economical
problems and they will start to solve big social problems with big sociology
companies.
