Dirty world may be error centered.Humans are not stupid animals do not build things invaluable,
 except youtubers.In dirty states as India, as Bangladesh, Pakistan they may be created a world
 of errors.If ground is full of trash, you have many messages on the ground.If you have many 
mistakes in life, you have many chance to gain experience to survive.

    As some in these worlds are white skin and some of them are black skin, they needed to find a
 common path of less conflict, thus India became a state of peace and they created a peace centered
 culture for India.They assumed, most valuable thing in world or in life is peace.This is their 
theory about life, so if someone is looking for answer about peace, needs to go close to India to 
find answers.There are conditions in life, overly peace is also a mistake.Mostly criminals hang out
 conflict centered and try to perceive life as conflict due to wild social environment, they 
assume only peace is not enough for life as they experience many fight, many traumatics events 
person can not handle without being a powerful person, they center fight and power in life.
If it is asked, where are most peaceful states in world, answer will be most crowded states.
They needed to arrange peace to not lose ties of state organisation to not lose their lands, 
thus, as it is a crowded place, a fight or a conflict understood as most dangerous act, they 
first arranged peace for their home.The reason crowded world use more motorcycle than cars, 
first there are not enough place for cars, second it is more economical to use motorcycle as
 many people do not have a good economy, it is a world can be defined as low economy.Low economy 
helps person to understand what is value and what is valuable due to its conditions
of not having and suprising.It is not better to have low economy but if we say it does not have
 advantages, it would be a wrong saying.

   Crowded world are scaring states for people who are not from a crowded world.Old Capitalism
 created many bias in people to not see a united humanity, to not see people are organising around
 something like communism.Religion was also a factor to not let others gain a achivement or 
establish big companies for their culture of religion to have rights in world.Social inequality
 level was overly high in old capitalism times.After Google invented YouTube, after arrive of 
information age, social ineqaulity level felt lower levels because it was possible to make money
 from internet, this chain breaking step, caused everyone to understand, nothing happens if 
everyone is working on something and xenophobia seemed like a not good idea as discriminating 
someone from another culture may cause some others to discriminate your culture one day.

   Even though level of social inequality felt in time, humans developed better cars, better 
computer, better snacks to enjoy, developed websites to help people to make money online, 
many worked from home, human did not understand yet what is valuable one.Western is a developed 
culture.Eastern has developed cultures.Humans did not understand what do they do to be developed.
They define values to valuable things as freedom.
